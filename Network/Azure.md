> [!NOTE] Budgets vs. Cost Alerts?
> 1. **Budgets**:
>     
>     - Budgets allow you to set a **financial spending limit** for a specific subscription, resource group, or service over a defined time period (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
>     - You can monitor and track your spending relative to the budget you have set.
>     - Azure provides notifications when your spending reaches a certain percentage of your budget (e.g., 50%, 75%, or 100%), but it doesnâ€™t stop services automatically when the budget is exceeded.
>     - **Example**: You set a budget of $500 for your Azure subscription for the month. Azure will notify you when your spending hits $250 (50%), $375 (75%), and $500 (100%).
> 2. **Cost Alerts**:
>     
>     - Cost alerts are used to notify you based on specific spending thresholds or anomalies.
>     - These alerts can be set independently of a budget and can be triggered when unexpected spending occurs, or specific conditions are met.
>     - **Example**: You create a cost alert to notify you when your spending exceeds $100 in a week, regardless of your monthly budget.
> 
> **Summary**:
> 
> - **Budgets** help you plan and monitor your spending over time.
> - **Cost Alerts** provide immediate notifications for custom thresholds or unexpected cost spikes.
