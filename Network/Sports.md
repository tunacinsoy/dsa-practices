- **Age:** 25 years
- **Weight:** 80 kg
- **Height:** 190 cm
- **Activity Level:** Actively going to the gym 3 days a week
- **Goal:** Muscle gain

### 1. **Calculate Your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**

The Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) represents the number of calories your body needs at rest to maintain vital functions like breathing and digestion. One commonly used formula to estimate BMR is the **Mifflin-St Jeor Equation**:

**BMR=10× weight (kg)+6.25 × height (cm)−5× age (years)+ 5**

Plugging in your details:

BMR=10×80+6.25×190−5×25+5=800+1,187.5−125+5=**1,867.5** calories/day

### 2. **Determine Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**

Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure accounts for all the calories you burn in a day, including physical activities. It's calculated by multiplying your BMR by an **activity factor**:

- **Sedentary (little or no exercise):** BMR × 1.2
- **Lightly Active (light exercise/sports 1-3 days/week):** BMR × 1.375
- **Moderately Active (moderate exercise/sports 3-5 days/week):** BMR × 1.55
- **Very Active (hard exercise/sports 6-7 days a week):** BMR × 1.725
- **Extra Active (very hard exercise/sports & physical job):** BMR × 1.9

Given that you go to the gym **3 days a week** and aim to **gain muscle**, you likely fall into the **Moderately Active** category.

TDEE=1,867.5×1.55≈2,893 calories/day
### 3. **Adjust for Muscle Gain**

To gain muscle, you need to consume more calories than your TDEE, creating a **caloric surplus**. A common recommendation is to add **250-500 calories** per day to support muscle growth without excessive fat gain.

Caloric Intake for Muscle Gain=TDEE+250 to 500≈3,143 to 3,393 calories/day

**Recommendation:** Aim for approximately **3,100 to 3,400 calories per day**.

### 4. **Optimize Macronutrient Distribution**

Balancing your macronutrients is crucial for effective muscle gain:

- **Protein:** Essential for muscle repair and growth.
    - **Recommendation:** 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight.
    - **For you:** 128g to 176g of protein per day.
- **Carbohydrates:** Provide energy for workouts and aid in recovery.
    - **Recommendation:** 45-60% of your total calories.
    - **For 3,200 calories/day:** Approximately 360g to 480g of carbohydrates.
- **Fats:** Support hormone production and overall health.
    - **Recommendation:** 20-35% of your total calories.
    - **For 3,200 calories/day:** Approximately 71g to 124g of fats.

**Example Breakdown for 3,200 Calories:**
- **Protein:** 160g (640 calories)
- **Carbohydrates:** 400g (1,600 calories)
- **Fats:** 120g (1,080 calories)

### 5. **Additional Tips**

- **Quality of Calories:** Focus on nutrient-dense foods such as lean meats, whole grains, healthy fats, fruits, and vegetables.
- **Meal Timing:** Distribute your protein intake evenly across meals to maximize muscle protein synthesis.
- **Hydration:** Stay well-hydrated to support overall performance and recovery.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent eating and training schedule to see optimal results.
- **Monitor Progress:** Adjust your calorie intake based on weight gain and muscle growth. If you're not gaining muscle, consider increasing your calories slightly.

### 7. **Sample Daily Meal Plan (3,200 Calories)**

**Breakfast:**

- 4 scrambled eggs
- 2 slices of whole-grain toast with avocado
- 1 cup of oatmeal with berries and honey

**Snack:**

- Greek yogurt with a handful of nuts and a banana

**Lunch:**

- Grilled chicken breast

**Dinner:**

- Baked salmon or lean beef
- Sweet potatoes
- Mixed green salad with assorted vegetables and vinaigrette

**Evening Snack:**

- Cottage cheese with pineapple or another fruit
- A handful of almonds

### Conclusion

To effectively gain muscle, aim for a daily calorie intake of **3,100 to 3,400 calories**, ensuring a balanced distribution of macronutrients. Monitor your progress and adjust as needed, and consider seeking personalized advice from nutrition and fitness professionals to optimize your muscle-building journey.
