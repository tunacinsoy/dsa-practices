**Note:** Some companies only want to develop the application, and leave the infrastructure management overhead to the cloud provider, and this is offered as serverless by cloud providers. AWS has serverless offerings called ECS and Fargate and although you only pay for the resources you consume in Fargate, it is more expensive than running your tasks on EC2, especially when running long-running services such as a web server. A rule of thumb is to run long-running online tasks within EC2 and batch tasks with Fargate. That will give you the best cost optimization. ECS is an excellent tool choice if you run exclusively on AWS and donâ€™t have a future multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy. Fargate makes deploying and running your containers easier without worrying about the infrastructure behind the scenes.

**Note:** Google Cloud Run is also an serverless offering which runs knative under the hood.

**Note**: Serverless means that if I am not using my resource, then it should scale down to zero; whenever i need to use it, it should scale up. Kubernetes is not serverless, we must have infrastructure defined, and long-running services should have at least a single instance running at a particular time. This makes managing microservices applications a pain and resource-intensive. Knative is an offering to be able to host serverless workloads within kubernetes cluster.
